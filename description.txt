Infernus Mod

Infernus Mod is a major content mod that adds a multitude of new and unique items, enemies, bosses, mechanics and Quality of Life changes. Infernus mod has been developed by only
one developer for the past 3 years, although it has only been published for 1 year. It has been made a with a quality over quantity mindset. I have created this mod as a way to replay Terraria with some additions and changes to vanilla
Terraria to make it more interesting.

Infernus Mod is mostly multiplayer compatible (expect bugs) and cross content compatible. However I persaude you to check if the other mods you are using are also
compatible before doing so.
